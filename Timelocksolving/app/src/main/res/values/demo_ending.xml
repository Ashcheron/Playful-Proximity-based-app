        <item>You presented your evidence to the police and they were astonished. How could a simple student solve this case faster than them? They brought Richard in for further questioning and he confessed, apparently Catherine knew about his scheme of selling grades and so he waited until she was alone in the Workshop and murdered her. You were right! Most important is, Richard is going to jail, where he belongs!</item>
