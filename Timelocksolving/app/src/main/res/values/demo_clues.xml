        <item>You are walking through the campus when nearby students’ chatter catches your ears.\n\n\"I’m so bad at Mathematical Analysis, I think I’m gonna fail. But Richard’s classes are so boring...\"\n\n\"[Professor Richard]? From what I’ve heard there is more than one way to get good grades from here. You should meet him in his office hours, take your wallet.\"\n\nIntriguing, but could there be truth to those rumours?</item>
